          &emsp; I am a driven and passionate software engineer with a strong desire to learn and push myself and others to excellence. I have a proven track record of success in both academic and professional settings. I have demonstrated my ability to work independently, as part of a team, and as the leader of a team. I am also a quick learner and I am always eager to take on new challenges. I am confident that I have the skills and experience that you are looking for in a software engineer.<br>
          &emsp; As a tutor at the University of Central Florida, I helped students of all levels learn and understand computer science concepts. I was able to effectively communicate complex technical topics in a clear and concise way while also developing strong problem-solving and analytical skills.<br>
          &emsp; As a software engineer intern at Qualtrics, I worked on a team to develop a new application to help the team's developer experience. I was responsible for designing, implementing, and testing all aspects of this project. I also worked with other team members to ensure that the application met the requirements of the project and exceeded them as well.
