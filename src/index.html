        <p class="summary-text">
          &emsp; I am a driven and passionate software engineer with a strong desire to learn and push myself and others to excellence. I have a proven track record of success in both academic and professional settings. I have demonstrated my ability to work independently, as part of a team, and as the leader of a team. I am also a quick learner and I am always eager to take on new challenges. I am confident that I have the skills and experience that you are looking for in a software engineer.<br>
          &emsp; As a tutor at the University of Central Florida, I helped students of all levels learn and understand computer science concepts. I was able to effectively communicate complex technical topics in a clear and concise way while also developing strong problem-solving and analytical skills.<br>
          &emsp; During my time as a software engineer intern at Qualtrics, I worked on a team to develop a new application to help the team's developer experience. I was responsible for designing, implementing, and testing all aspects of this project. I also worked with other team members to ensure that the application met the requirements of the project and exceeded them as well.<br>
          &emsp; As a software engineer at Worldwide, I make the most of all of my skills. Having been there for a short period of time and quickly learning the tech stack and areas of improvement to development, I am able to take on a lot of responsibility like mobile development, web development, git versioning, project management, teaching my peers about the tools being used, being a part of the design process, developing demo apps for potential clients, seeking improvements to development experience, and more.
